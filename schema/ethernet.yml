          Option to force admin state over selected port.
          Setting to <false> immediately shuts down power.
          Setting to <true> starts PoE hanshake
          (Power sourcing equipment < - > Powered Device) sequence and

        description:
          Option to force device's PSE (Power sourcing equipment)
          to invoke a PoE port reset sequence.
          This option can be used to reset PoE port without flickering
          it via <admin-mode> down/up sequence.
        type: boolean
      detection:
        description:
          The detection mode is used to set the type of devices that are allowed for powering up.
          The PoE controller can be configured to detect only IEEE standard devices
          or pre-IEEE legacy devices (which were pre-standard - non-IEEE 802.3af compliant).
          For example, if "dot3af" is used (PoE, max up to 15.4 W), and Powered Device drains >15.4W,
          Power sourcing equipment won't allow this port to drain power.
        type: string
        examples:
          - "2pt-dot3af"
          - "2pt-dot3af+legacy"
          - "4pt-dot3af"
          - "4pt-dot3af+legacy"
          - "dot3bt"

          - "legacy"
        default: dot3bt

      priority:
        description:
          Option to set priority to each PoE port. When the PoE switch has less power available
          and more ports are required to supply power, higher priority ports are receive power
          in preference to lower priority ports.
        type: string
        default: low
        examples:
          - "critical"
          - "high"
          - "medium"
          - "low"
